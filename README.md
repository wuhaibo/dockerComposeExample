## Introduction

Here we want to create a docker-compose file which build a local docker image and run the container which share a data volume with host. 

## Docker 
We create here a very simple python container which writes to a file every second.  

```docker
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM python:3.7
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/python","/app/main.py"]
```

## Docker-Compose

In docker compose we simply create a service called monitor and a data volume shared between host and container. 
```
version: "2.0"
services:
  monitor:
    container_name: docker-compose-example-container
    build: .
    volumes:
      - /opt/docker-share:/var/docker-share
```

## Deploy to Server
- First make sure docker and docker-compose are installed on server. We use Ubuntu.
- Upload all files to server
- run following cmd to build and start the container in background
```bash
# build image before start container and run the container in background
sudo docker-compose up --build -d 

# stop service/container, monitor is the service name in docker-compose.yml
sudo docker-compose stop monitor 
```
